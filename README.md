Project Alta Overview


Project overview:
Fitbit is commissioning a designer to create a ‘Product Card’ for their new Alta HR fitness tracker. The Product Card will be used on the homepage of their website to drive traffic to the product page. It will also be repurposed for various digital advertisements over social media platforms and other influential fitness websites. The design must be bright, modern and up-to-date, in terms of ultra modern UX techniques. The product is the key focal point here, so make sure that the design really enables the product to shine.

The Alta HR allows users to track their movement, calories and heart rate whenever it’s being worn. It can also receive texts, calls and calendar alerts, and will also remind the user to move when they’ve been sedentary for too long. Remember all of these key features when developing your concept. The design needs to portray health, fitness and wellbeing, but with a nod to modern day lifestyle and convenience.

The Alta HR comes in a variety of colours, so you have a fairly extensive colour palette to choose from. The client has asked that you use the typeface ‘Proxima Nova’ or something very similar. This will be a good exercise in following an existing brand style, while creating something original and eye-catching.
We have included a product asset for this brief, you must use the product image provided in the assets folder. The Product Card must include the main product information, such as the price, the colours and sizes it’s available in, and the main features. More details can be hidden within various drop down sections. For further information on the brand and the product, head here.

Remember, this design is all about user experience and user satisfaction. The design must be easy and intuitive to use, it must also break down responsibly without feeling like a totally different design. A good practice to follow is to design from ‘mobile up’, then you can ensure all of the main elements are legible and well position on a smart phone before building up through to tablet and desktop layouts, where you can then start to introduce a few more elements and/or transition states. The size of the final design you submit must be 800 x 600px.

Modern UI should utilise modern browser and software capabilities. Think vibrant colours, drop shadows, various layers and interesting transitions states. Test your design over multiple devices to see how it looks on your smartphone, laptop or desktop computer.

Make sure to upload your designs so the community can see what you’ve been up to. We’ll also be completing this brief in-house, so keep your eyes peeled for our submission. Good luck!
